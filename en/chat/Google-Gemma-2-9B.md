# Free Google Gemma 2 9B

Google Gemma is an open-source large model by Google; open-source means it can be used for free, but unfortunately, it's too heavy for most machines to handle; what to do about it?

The answer is to simply use the Gemini API; the free version of Gemini's API offers the following quotas:


```
15 RPM (Requests Per Minute)

1 million TPM (Tokens Per Minute)

1500 RPD (Requests Per Day)
```


So, the free version should be enough for your use, right? Moreover, by binding a bank card to Google Cloud, you can apply for $300 in free credits for 3 months. If a few friends team up, it's more than enough to last a year with plenty to spare, and you can even provide it to others for use. A monthly limit of $100 for the API is more than enough for you to 'play around' with.

Of course, you'll need a virtual credit card for this. Here I recommend [wildcard](https://wildcard.com.cn/i/S84LVTDN), which has been proven effective!

## Free Online Experience (Loading may be slow, requires magic)

Of course, you can also use the online experience interface for online experience. The `loading may be slow, please be patient`, and it's best to have an account on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/).
