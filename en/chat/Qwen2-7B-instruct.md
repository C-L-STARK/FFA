# Free Qwen2-7B-instruct

The open-source large model provided by Alibaba is currently quite a good experience. Alibaba Cloud also offers a variety of [free AI trial services](https://free.aliyun.com/?product=1395,1396,1397,1430,1398), such as image recognition and OCR license recognition. Everyone can give it a try. It's free anyway. Just register an account, verify your identity with Alipay's facial recognition, and you can experience it at will. It's like a trip.


## Free Online Experience (Loading may be slow, requires magic)

Of course, you can also use the online experience interface for online experience. The `loading may be slow, please be patient`, and it's best to have an account on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/).
