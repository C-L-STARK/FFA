# Free Zhipu Qingyan Large Model glm-4v-9b

Zhipu Large Model, full name: Zhipu Qingyan, <a href="https://ChatGLM.cn/">official website</a>

Currently, Zhipu Qingyan offers `25 million free Tokens` upon registration. `If you are a user of the OpenAI API, by providing a screenshot to their customer service email, you can also receive a special offer of 5 yuan for 100 million tokens.`

Moreover, the Zhipu Qingyan large model now supports internet connectivity and multimodality. Although its capabilities are not as strong as gpt-4o, it is much better than gpt-3.5-turbo.

The 25 million free tokens are valid for a default of 1 month; enough for everyone to enjoy for a month. If you are lucky enough to purchase 100 million tokens (valid for 3 months), you can even share them generously with friends!

The method of use is very simple. Find the open-source WebUI on github, fill in the key, and you can enjoy it immediately.

Here we especially recommend lobe-chat. To avoid key leaks, please use the official deployment. Conveyor belt: <a href="https://chat-preview.lobehub.com/" target="_blank">lobe-chat</a>
